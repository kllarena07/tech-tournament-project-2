This is an example repository of how to use the Google Gemini API and how you can use it.

Under `/backend` you'll find 2 examples of code for how to invoke the API as a script using the Python SDK and how to set it up to work with a Flask server backend.

This backend is then connected to a NextJS frontend with a chat bot UI.

To run both of these, you will need a Gemini API Key and the necessary `.env` files.
